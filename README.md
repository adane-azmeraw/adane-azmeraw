I am Adane I was born in Ethiopia since 2002. With a passion for technology and a dream of becoming a great programmer,
I embarked on a journey that led me to pursue a degree in computer science at Hawassa University.
Recognizing the importance of a solid educational foundation, I enrolled in Hawassa University to pursue a degree in computer science.
The university provided me with a comprehensive curriculum that covered a wide range of subjects,
including programming languages, algorithms, software development, and data structures.
I devoted me to my studies, consistently seeking opportunities to enhance my knowledge and skills.
